# Wemos-Mega
           Wemos Mega is Arduino Mega compatible board plus additional ESP8266 with 32Mb Flash. It allows flexible configurations for connections between ATmega2560, ESP8266 and USB serial. Arduino sketches can be uploaded to ATmega2560 or ESP8266 via USB separately and they can either work together to form a system or independently. The configurations are set by the onboard DIP switches.

           

           The onboard ESP8266 can be flashed with popular firmwares like NodeMCU firmware or ESP8266 AT command-set firmware, as well as be programmed with Arduino IDE.
